    "# X-ray diffraction analysis\n",
    "The aim of the project is to create a code able to import and plot data coming from an X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment, detect and list the characteristic peaks, while avoiding those coming from $K_\\beta$ transitions since already counted in $K_\\alpha$ peaks, and finally match each peak to its own phase.\n",
    "A second task is to make the code as much general as possible (regardless of type of the source file and the complexity of the experimental pattern), accurate in results and simple for the user. To this end, the code consists of a single function (you can find the final code at the end of the notebook and in a separate file called Project.ipynb) whose inputs are directly asked to the user by the interface. Among such inputs, two of them allow the user to tune two paramenters so that he can manually adjust the peaks recognition step and make it more accurate.\n",
    "Although the function is a single one, the notebook presenting the work is divided in sections to guide the reader through the steps that lead to the final result. Such steps are reported after importing the necessary python libraries and specifically they are:\n",

    "Although the 'find_peaks' function is available in numpy library, it does not allow to filter out the peaks related to $K_\\beta$ transitions. Thus a different code is made to fulfill this task. Such code considers the intensity value of each index in the 'intensity' array and compares it with the neighbouring ones in a range proportional to the 'spacing' value provided as input. Since spacing is an optional input of the function and its default value depends on the shape of the 'angle' array, it is defined after the latter. The 'i' index is picked as belonging to a peak if it corresponds to the maximum intensity in the range and has a sufficiently large difference (depending on the 'min_diff' value) with the minimum value in the range. The angles associated to indexes considered as peaks are saved in the \"peaksang\" array while their intensity values are listed in \"peaksint\".\n",
